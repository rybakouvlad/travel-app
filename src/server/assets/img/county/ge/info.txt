1.Mutso: Once Georgia's most impregnable stronghold throughout the Middle Ages, the fortified town of Mutso was restored and rebuilt in 2014. In 2019, the town bagged the Europa Nostra Award, Europe's most coveted award in cultural heritage.
2.Gelati Monastery: It's a miracle that these vivid specimens have survived, and show shockingly little damage, since most frescoes in Georgian churches were whitewashed by Russian imperialists in the 19th century.
3.Vardzia: This nine-tiered cave complex rising above the parched foothills of Samtskhe-Javakheti was constructed as an elaborate bunker in the 12th century.
4.Gergeti Trinity Church: This church is one of Georgia's most impressive sights thanks to its dramatic hilltop position in the shadow of Mount Kazbek, Europe's fifth-highest summit.
5.Ananuri: This castle complex on the Aragvi River in Georgia once served as the residence of the eristavis (Dukes) of Aragvi.
6. Dartlo: Keep an eye out for khatebi, the low stone huts on the fringes of town that the indigenous Tush people visit for worship and animal sacrifice.
