1.Colosseum, Rome: The awe-inspiring amphitheater echoes with ghosts of gladiators past, the roar of wild animals and the swash of sea battles, cheered on by up to 80,000 baying spectators. The arena, partly ruined by earthquake and robbers, is an enduring symbol of the Roman empire.
2.Ponte Vecchio, Florence: The Ponte Vecchio, or Old Bridge, is a Florence landmark, the only Arno River crossing to survive the retreating German army at the end of World War II. It's famous for the shops which line its span -- once butchers and fishmongers, now jewelers, art dealers and souvenir-sellers.
3.Tuscany: The region of Tuscany in central Italy evokes myriad images: of rolling hills, sleepy villages and dreamy vistas; earthy cooking and regional wines; Renaissance treasures such as the cities of Florence, and Pisa with its leaning tower. There's coastline and islands, too. Tuscany has its own riviera and hip beach resort of Tirrenia.
4.Salina, Aeolian Islands, Sicily: Salina is the second-largest and the greenest island of the Aeolian archipelago off northeast Sicily. It's made up of two principal volcanoes Monte dei Porri (860 meters) and Monte Fossa delle Felci (962 meters), both long since extinct. Its steep verdant slopes are famous for grapes, olives and capers, while the port of Santa Marina Salina offers a focal spot for tourists.
5.Lake Iseo, Lombardy: Smaller, quieter and arguably more charming than its more famous cousins Lake Como and Lake Garda -- and sandwiched between them -- Lake Iseo is a unsung gem of northern Italy.
6.Treviso, Veneto: Canals, cobbled streets, medieval city walls, frescoed churches -- it could be Venice just down the road, but Treviso is more than just a gateway to La Serenissima. This hidden gem makes it worth resisting Venice's siren call for a day or two.
